# Datasets
**2019 ACS Data**

Description: This dataset contains demographic and housing data from the 2019 American Community Survey for census tract in Alameda County, California. For my (potential) project, I'm hoping to use the racial demographic data for tracts specifically in Oakland, California as one element of my tree equity analysis.

**Oakland Tree Data**

Description: This dataset contains the location of each sidewalk tree and empty tree well in Oakland, California. I hope to use this to answer my (potential) research question: Are there racial inequalities in the location of Oakland's sidewalk trees?
