## About me
My name is Michael Rosen and I'm a first-year MURP student at UCLA. Prior to attending UCLA, I mostly worked as a journalist. I was an editor at Apple News and, before that, an editor at SFGate. Here are a couple articles I wrote:
* [This Bay Area town is among the country's most unique](https://www.sfgate.com/neighborhoods/eb/article/Kensington-Bay-Area-unincorporated-town-Contra-Cos-13836096.php)
* [AC Transit just eliminated fares. Why can't BART do the same?](https://www.sfgate.com/public-transportation/article/why-isnt-bart-free-ac-transit-covid-19-15153882.php)
