# Michael Rosen's UP206 Repo File
## About me
My name is Michael Rosen and I'm a first-year MURP student at UCLA. Prior to attending UCLA, I mostly worked as a journalist. I was an editor at Apple News and, before that, an editor at SFGate. Here are a couple articles I wrote:
* [This Bay Area town is among the country's most unique](https://www.sfgate.com/neighborhoods/eb/article/Kensington-Bay-Area-unincorporated-town-Contra-Cos-13836096.php)
* [AC Transit just eliminated fares. Why can't BART do the same?](https://www.sfgate.com/public-transportation/article/why-isnt-bart-free-ac-transit-covid-19-15153882.php)

I grew up in Olympia, Washington and spent the last 10 years living in the East Bay. I enjoy tennis, buses, novels, poker, and high-stakes fantasy baseball.
## Course description and objectives
My understanding is that UP206A, or Introduction to GIS and Spatial Data Science, will provide a basic facility with the foundation that sits beneath mapping tools like ArcGIS. Through the use of open-source tools like Python, the class will allow the students of UP206A to deliver map outputs without the constraints of a proprietary software.
My objectives for UP206A are to:
* Acquire a basic knowledge of Python
* Explore the world of spatial data and learn where I can find cool spatial datasets
* Build skills that I can use in a professional context
## Project ideas
I'd like to compare race/income data across a city's census tracts against:
* Oakland's sidewalk trees 
* Bus stops on LA Metro bus lines  â€” which communities does a given LA Metro bus line serve?
* Bicycle parking data in San Francisco
* SFMTA parking citations
